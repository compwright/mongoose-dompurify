# mongoose-dompurify

[DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) plugin for Mongoose schemas that sanitizes documents before saving.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save mongoose-dompurify
```

## Usage

```javascript
const sanitizerPlugin = require('mongoose-dompurify');

MyMongooseSchema.plugin(sanitizerPlugin, {
  // Do not sanitize these fields (default: [])
  skip: [],

  // Encode HTML entities? (default: false)
  encodeHtmlEntities: false,

  // Configure DOMPurify, see https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify for a list of options (default: undefined)
  sanitizer: {
    SAFE_FOR_JQUERY: true,
    SAFE_FOR_TEMPLATES: true,
    ALLOWED_TAGS: []
  }
});
```

When saving a document generated with `MyMongooseSchema`, mongoose-dompurify will automatically perform sanitization before saving to the database.
